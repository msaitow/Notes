abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) and an advanced ab initio technique based on density matrix renormalization group (DMRG-CASPT2) were employed to investigate a reactive N-bridged high-valent diiron-oxo species involved in H-abstraction reactions. We studied in detail two important doublet states, the ground state with two iron(IV) centers and a mixed valence FeV-FeIV excited state. We found that the latter state is low-lying. Furthermore, its electronic structure and spin density imply that it has significantly higher H-abstraction reactivity than the ground state. This low-lying excited state might be the reason behind the high oxidation reactivity of this diiron-oxo species towards methane.}

The computational scaling of CCSDtqph coincides with that for the standard coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD), yet with a much large prefactor. The approximate schemes to linearize the external excitations higher than doubles are significantly cheaper than the full CCSDtqph model. These models are applied to investigate the bond dissociation energies of diatomic molecules (HF, F2, CuH, and CuF), and the potential energy surfaces of the bond dissociation processes of HF, CuH, H2O, and C2H4. Among the approximate models, CCSD{tqph}hyb provides very accurate descriptions compared with CCSDtqph for all of the tested systems. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

After introducing some fundamental quantum mechanical concepts, the foundations of DFT and their realization in the framework of the Kohn–Sham construction are described. Following a brief exposition of the computational machinery required to carry out large-scale DFT calculations, the application of analytic derivative theory to DFT is developed in some detail. The cases covered include geometric, electric, magnetic and time-dependent perturbations. The developed theoretical apparatus is then applied to the calculations of molecular structures, vibrational energies as well as a wide variety of properties including absorption, circular dichroism, magnetic circular dichroism, resonance Raman, X-ray absorption, Mössbauer and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. Finally, the important subjects of spin state energetics and exchange couplings in oligomeric transition metal clusters is discussed."

The first-order wavefunction is first calculated with a level shift parameter large enough to remove the intruder states. The effect of the level shift on the second-order energy is removed by a back correction technique (the LS correction). It is shown that intruder states are removed with little effect on the remaining part of the correlation energy. New potential curves have been computed for the X1Σg+ and the á3Σu+ states of Cr2 using large basis sets (ANO: 8s7p6d4f2g) and accounting for relativistic effects, 3s and 3p correlation, and basis set superposition effects. The computed spectroscopic constants (experimental values in parentheses) for the X1Σg+ state are re = 1.69(1.68) Å, ΔG12 = 535(452) cm−1, D0 = 1.54(1.44) eV.

abstract = "In multiconfigurational perturbation theory, so-called intruders may cause singularities in the potential energy functions, at geometries where an energy denominator becomes zero. When the singularities are weak, they may be successfully removed by level shift techniques. When applied to excited states, a small shift merely moves the singularity. A large shift may cause new divergencies, and too large shifts are unacceptable since the potential function is affected in regions further away from the singularities. This Letter presents an alternative which may be regarded as an imaginary shift. The singularities are not moved, but disappear completely. They are replaced by a small distortion of the potential function. Applications to the N2 ground state, its A3/gEu+ state, and the Cr2 ground state show that the distortion caused by this procedure is small."

abstract="We present two new hybrid meta exchange- correlation functionals, called M06 and M06-2X. The M06 functional is parametrized including both transition metals and nonmetals, whereas the M06-2X functional is a high-nonlocality functional with double the amount of nonlocal exchange (2X), and it is parametrized only for nonmetals.The functionals, along with the previously published M06-L local functional and the M06-HF full-Hartree--Fock functionals, constitute the M06 suite of complementary functionals. We assess these four functionals by comparing their performance to that of 12 other functionals and Hartree--Fock theory for 403 energetic data in 29 diverse databases, including ten databases for thermochemistry, four databases for kinetics, eight databases for noncovalent interactions, three databases for transition metal bonding, one database for metal atom excitation energies, and three databases for molecular excitation energies. We also illustrate the performance of these 17 methods for three databases containing 40 bond lengths and for databases containing 38 vibrational frequencies and 15 vibrational zero point energies. We recommend the M06-2X functional for applications involving main-group thermochemistry, kinetics, noncovalent interactions, and electronic excitation energies to valence and Rydberg states. We recommend the M06 functional for application in organometallic and inorganometallic chemistry and for noncovalent interactions.",

abstract  ="The impact of orbital localization on the efficiency and accuracy of the optimized-orbital coupled cluster model is examined for the prediction of chiroptical properties{,} in particular optical rotation. The specific rotations of several test cases-(P)-[4]triangulane{,} (S)-1-phenylethanol{,} and chiral conformers of 1-fluoropentane{,} heptane{,} and nonane-were computed using an approach in which localization is enforced throughout the orbital optimization and subsequent linear response computation. This method provides a robust local-correlation scheme for future production-level implementation. Although the cross-over point between the canonical and localized coupled cluster approach lies at larger molecules than for ground-state energies{,} the scheme presented should still provide reduced scaling sufficient to investigate much larger molecules than are presently accessible."}

abstract="The deficiencies of common ab initio methods for the reliable prediction of the equilibrium structures of compounds composed of only the fluorine, oxygen and nitrogen atoms are investigated. Specifically, the importance of using large one-particle basis sets with multiple sets of polarization functions has been studied. Additionally, the need for a set of f basis functions was investigated. Several different single reference electron correlation methods have been tested in order to determine whether it is possible for a single reference based method to be routinely used on such chemical systems. These electron correlation methods include second order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), singles and doubles configuration interaction (CISD), the coupled pair functional (CPF) approach and singles and doubles coupled cluster (CCSD) theory. The molecular systems studied include difluoroperoxide (FOOF), the cis form of the NO dimer, cis and trans difluorodiazene (FNNF) and the transition state to interconversion of the cis and trans isomers of FNNF. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the cis-trans isomerization transition state has been reported. At the highest level of theory employed, the equilibrium structures of cis and trans FNNF agree very well with the experimental structures. However, the barrier to interconversion is predicted to be 65 kcal/mole, which is substantially higher than the experimental activation energy of 32 kcal/mole. Potential sources of error are discussed. A new diagnostic method for determining a priori the reliability of single reference based electron correlation methods is suggested and discussed.",

This diagnostic T1 is defined for use with self-consistent-field molecular orbitals and is invariant to the same orbital rotations as the coupled-cluster energy. T1 is investigated for several different chemical systems which exhibit a range of multireference behavior and is shown to be an excellent measure of the importance of nondynamical electron correlation and is far superior to C0 from a singles and doubles configuration interaction wave function. It is further suggested that when the aim is to recover a large fraction of the dynamical electron correlation energy, a large T1 (i.e., >0.02) probably indicates the need for a multireference electron correlation procedure.}

abstract = "In photosynthesis, cyanobacteria, algae and plants fix carbon dioxide (CO2) into carbohydrates; this is necessary to support life on Earth. Over 50 years ago, Otto Heinrich Warburg discovered a unique stimulatory role of \{CO2\} in the Hill reaction (i.e., \{O2\} evolution accompanied by reduction of an artificial electron acceptor), which, obviously, does not include any carbon fixation pathway; Warburg used this discovery to support his idea that \{O2\} in photosynthesis originates in CO2. During the 1960s, a large number of researchers attempted to decipher this unique phenomenon, with limited success. In the 1970s, Alan Stemler, in Govindjee's lab, perfected methods to get highly reproducible results, and observed, among other things, that the turnover of Photosystem \{II\} (PSII) was stimulated by bicarbonate ions (hydrogen carbonate): the effect would be on the donor or the acceptor, or both sides of PSII. In 1975, Thomas Wydrzynski, also in Govindjee's lab, discovered that there was a definite bicarbonate effect on the electron acceptor (the plastoquinone) side of PSII. The most recent 1.9 Å crystal structure of PSII, unequivocally shows HCO3− bound to the non-heme iron that sits in-between the bound primary quinone electron acceptor, QA, and the secondary quinone electron acceptor QB. In this review, we focus on the historical development of our understanding of this unique bicarbonate effect on the electron acceptor side of PSII, and its mechanism as obtained by biochemical, biophysical and molecular biological approaches in many laboratories around the World. We suggest an atomic level model in which HCO3−/CO32 − plays a key role in the protonation of the reduced QB. In addition, we make comments on the role of bicarbonate on the donor side of PSII, as has been extensively studied in the labs of Alan Stemler (USA) and Vyacheslav Klimov (Russia). We end this review by discussing the uniqueness of bicarbonate's role in oxygenic photosynthesis and its role in the evolutionary development of O2-evolving PSII.

The NHI is situated between the two PQs QA and QB that serve as one-electron transmitter and substrate of the reductase part of PSII, respectively. Among the ligands of the NHI is a (bi)carbonate originating from CO2, the substrate of the dark reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis.

abstract = "The semiquinone-iron complex of photosystem \{II\} was studied using electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Two forms of the signal were investigated: 1), the native g ∼ 1.9 form; and 2), the g ∼ 1.84 form, which is well known in purple bacterial reaction centers and occurs in photosystem \{II\} when treated with formate. The g ∼ 1.9 form shows low- and high-field edges at g ∼ 3.5 and g &lt; 0.8, respectively, and resembles the g ∼ 1.84 form in terms of shape and width. Both types of \{ESR\} signal were simulated using the theoretical approach used previously for the \{BRC\} complex, a spin Hamiltonian formalism in which the semiquinone radical magnetically interacts (J ∼ 1 cm−1) with the nearby high-spin Fe2+. The two forms of \{ESR\} signal differ mainly by an axis rotation of the exchange coupling tensor (J) relative to the zero-field tensor (D) and a small increase in the zero-field parameter D (∼6 cm−1). Density functional theory calculations were conducted on model semiquinone-iron systems to identify the physical nature of these changes. The replacement of formate (or glutamate in the bacterial reaction centers) by bicarbonate did not result in changes in the coupling environment. However, when carbonate (CO32−) was used instead of bicarbonate, the exchange and zero-field tensors did show changes that matched those obtained from the spectral simulations. This indicates that 1), the doubly charged carbonate ion is responsible for the g ∼ 1.9 form of the semiquinone-iron signal; and 2), carbonate, rather than bicarbonate, is the ligand to the iron. "

Interaction energies are calculated at the dispersion-corrected DFT, MP2 (second-order Møller-Plesset), and DLPNO-CCSD(T) (domain-based local pair natural orbital-coupled cluster, including single, double and perturbative triple excitations) levels of theory, combined with extended triple- or quadruple-ζ AO (atom-centered orbital) basis sets. Thermostatistical contributions to the free binding energy are calculated from harmonic frequencies at the efficient HF-3c (minimal basis Hartree-Fock with three corrections) level, while solvation effects in benzene are accounted for by the COSMO-RS (conductor-like screening model for realistic solvents) continuum model. Comparison with the recently measured experimental value for the free association energy of the FLP 1 reveals agreement between theory and experiment within the estimated error bars. The computed gas phase interaction energies for both FLPs are similar (about −13 kcal mol−1), with only small variations (about ±3 kcal mol−1) for various quantum chemical methods, when London dispersion interactions are accounted for properly. The association of the more “frustrated” FLP 1 is mainly driven by nondirectional dispersion forces, resulting in non-preferential orientations, which is in agreement with experimental results. On the other hand, in FLP 2 with the “smaller” base, the boron and phosphorous atoms face each other in the favored complex structure, indicating a weak PB donor-acceptor interaction. This conformation of 2 seems to be more suitable for small molecule (e.g., H2) activations.},

  abstract = {[NiFe] hydrogenases catalyze the reversible oxidation of dihydrogen. The corresponding catalytic cycle involves a formidable number of redox states of the Ni-Fe active site; these can be distinguished experimentally by the IR stretching frequencies of their CN and CO ligands coordinated to iron. These spectroscopic fingerprints serve as sensitive probes for the intrinsic electronic structure of the metal core and, indirectly, for the structural composition of the active site. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) was used to calculate vibrational frequencies, by focusing on the EPR-silent intermediate states that contain divalent metal centers. By using the well-characterized Ni-C and Ni-B states as references, we identified candidates for the Ni-SIr, Ni-SIa, and Ni-R states by matching the predicted relative frequency shifts with experimental results. The Ni-SIr and Ni-SIa states feature a water molecule loosely bound to nickel and a formally vacant bridge. Both states are connected to each other through protonation equilibria; that is, in the Ni-SIa state one of the terminal thiolates is protonated, whereas in Ni-SIr this thiolate is unprotonated. For the reduced Ni-R state two feasible models emerged: in one, H2 coordinates side-on to nickel, and the second features a hydride bridge and a protonated thiolate. The Ni-SU state remains elusive as no unequivocal correspondence between the experimental data and calculated frequencies of the models was found, thus indicating that a larger structural rearrangement might occur upon reduction from Ni-A to Ni-SU and that the bridging ligand might dissociate.}

abstract  ="A central question in biological water splitting concerns the oxidation states of the manganese ions that comprise the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II. Understanding the nature and order of oxidation events that occur during the catalytic cycle of five Si states (i = 0-4) is of fundamental importance both for the natural system and for artificial water oxidation catalysts. Despite the widespread adoption of the so-called {"}high-valent scheme{"}-where{,} for example{,} the Mn oxidation states in the S2 state are assigned as III{,} IV{,} IV{,} IV-the competing {"}low-valent scheme{"} that differs by a total of two metal unpaired electrons (i.e. III{,} III{,} III{,} IV in the S2 state) is favored by several recent studies for the biological catalyst. The question of the correct oxidation state assignment is addressed here by a detailed computational comparison of the two schemes using a common structural platform and theoretical approach. Models based on crystallographic constraints were constructed for all conceivable oxidation state assignments in the four (semi)stable S states of the oxygen evolving complex{,} sampling various protonation levels and patterns to ensure comprehensive coverage. The models are evaluated with respect to their geometric{,} energetic{,} electronic{,} and spectroscopic properties against available experimental EXAFS{,} XFEL-XRD{,} EPR{,} ENDOR and Mn K pre-edge XANES data. New 2.5 K 55Mn ENDOR data of the S2 state are also reported. Our results conclusively show that the entire S state phenomenology can only be accommodated within the high-valent scheme by adopting a single motif and protonation pattern that progresses smoothly from S0 (III{,} III{,} III{,} IV) to S3 (IV{,} IV{,} IV{,} IV){,} satisfying all experimental constraints and reproducing all observables. By contrast{,} it was impossible to construct a consistent cycle based on the low-valent scheme for all S states. Instead{,} the low-valent models developed here may provide new insight into the over-reduced S states and the states involved in the assembly of the catalytically active water oxidizing cluster."}

  abstract = {α-Ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent nonheme iron enzymes utilize a high-spin (HS) ferrous center to couple the activation of oxygen to the decarboxylation of the cosubstrate αKG to yield succinate and CO2, and to generate a high-valent ferryl species that then acts as an oxidant to functionalize the target CH bond. Herein a detailed analysis of the electronic-structure changes that occur in the oxygen activation by this enzyme was performed. The rate-limiting step, which is identical on the septet and quintet surfaces, is the nucleophilic attack of the distal O atom of the O2 adduct on the carbonyl group in αKG through a bicyclic transition state (5, 7TS1). Due to the different electronic structures in 5, 7TS1, the decay of 7TS1 leads to a ferric oxyl species, which undergoes a rapid intersystem crossing to form the ferryl intermediate. By contrast, a HS ferrous center ligated by a peroxosuccinate is obtained on the quintet surface following 5TS1. Thus, additional two single-electron transfer steps are required to afford the same FeIV–oxo species. However, the triplet reaction channel is catalytically irrelevant. The biological role of αKG played in the oxygen-activation reaction is dual. The αKG LUMO (CO π*) serves as an electron acceptor for the nucleophilic attack of the superoxide monoanion. On the other hand, the αKG HOMO (C1C2 σ) provides the second and third electrons for the further reduction of the superoxide. In addition to density functional theory, high-level ab initio calculations have been used to calculate the accurate energies of the critical points on the alternative potential-energy surfaces. Overall, the results delivered by the ab initio calculations are largely parallel to those obtained with the B3LYP density functional, thus lending credence to our conclusions.}

  abstract = {By state-of-the-art quantum chemical methods, we show that for bulky functional groups like cyclohexane, [20]fullerene, dodecahedrane, and C60, the attractive dispersion interaction can have a greater impact on stereochemistry than the repulsive steric effect, making the compact isomer the more stable one. In particular, for the double C60 adduct of pentacene 1, the syn isomer should be the main product instead of the anti one inferred in the original synthesis experiment (Y. Murata et al., J. Org. Chem.­ 1999, 64, 3483). With and without dispersion interactions taken into account, the Gibbs energy difference ΔG(syn−anti) is −6.36 and +1.15 kcal mol−1, respectively. This study reminds us that dispersion interactions as well as electrostatic or hyperconjugation effects, etc. can lead to some unusual stereochemical phenomena.}

  abstract = {Reliable thermochemical measurements and theoretical predictions for reactions involving large transition metal complexes in which long-range intramolecular London dispersion interactions contribute significantly to their stabilization are still a challenge, particularly for reactions in solution. As an illustrative and chemically important example, two reactions are investigated where a large dipalladium complex is quenched by bulky phosphane ligands (triphenylphosphane and tricyclohexylphosphane). Reaction enthalpies and Gibbs free energies were measured by isotherm titration calorimetry (ITC) and theoretically ‘back-corrected’ to yield 0 K gas-phase reaction energies (ΔE). It is shown that the Gibbs free solvation energy calculated with continuum models represents the largest source of error in theoretical thermochemistry protocols. The (‘back-corrected’) experimental reaction energies were used to benchmark (dispersion-corrected) density functional and wave function theory methods. Particularly, we investigated whether the atom-pairwise D3 dispersion correction is also accurate for transition metal chemistry, and how accurately recently developed local coupled-cluster methods describe the important long-range electron correlation contributions. Both, modern dispersion-corrected density functions (e.g., PW6B95-D3(BJ) or B3LYP-NL), as well as the now possible DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations, are within the ‘experimental’ gas phase reference value. The remaining uncertainties of 2–3 kcal mol−1 can be essentially attributed to the solvation models. Hence, the future for accurate theoretical thermochemistry of large transition metal reactions in solution is very promising.}

Benchmark tests reveal that these methods reproduce, with excellent accuracy, their canonical counterparts. At the same time, the speed up achieved by exploiting the locality of the electron correlation permits us to tackle chemical systems that, due to their size, would normally only be addressable with density functional theory. This review covers a broad variety of the chemical applications e.g. simulation of transition metal catalyzed reactions, estimation of weak interactions, and calculation of lattice properties in molecular crystals.

The locality analysis thus shows that a CC calculation on a large molecular system may be carried out in terms of CC calculations on small orbital fragments of the total molecular system, where the sizes of the orbital fragment spaces are determined in a black box manner to ensure that the CC correlation energy is calculated to a preset energy threshold. A practical implementation of the locality analysis is described, and numerical results are presented, which demonstrate that both the orbital fragment sizes and the relative energy error compared to a full CC calculation are independent of the molecular system size. }

abstract="Portability, efficiency, and ease of coding are all important considerations in choosing the programming model for a scalable parallel application. The message-passing programming model is widely used because of its portability, yet some applications are too complex to code in it while also trying to maintain a balanced computation load and avoid redundant computations. The shared-memory programming model simplifies coding, but it is not portable and often provides little control over interprocessor data transfer costs. This paper describes an approach, called Global Arrays (GAs), that combines the better features of both other models, leading to both simple coding and efficient execution. The key concept of GAs is that they provide a portable interface through which each process in a MIMD parallel program can asynchronously access logical blocks of physically distributed matrices, with no need for explicit cooperation by other processes. We have implemented the GA library on a variety of computer systems, including the Intel Delta and Paragon, the IBM SP-1 and SP-2 (all message passers), the Kendall Square Research KSR-1/2 and the Convex SPP-1200 (nonuniform access shared-memory machines), the CRAY T3D (a globally addressable distributed-memory computer), and networks of UNIX workstations. We discuss the design and implementation of these libraries, report their performance, illustrate the use of GAs in the context of computational chemistry applications, and describe the use of a GA performance visualization tool.",

CTF aims to scale high-dimensional tensor contractions such as those required in the Coupled Cluster (CC) electronic structure method to massively-parallel supercomputers. The framework preserves tensor structure by subdividing tensors cyclically, producing a regular parallel decomposition. An internal virtualization layer provides completely general mapping support while maintaining ideal load balance. The mapping framework decides on the best mapping for each tensor contraction at run-time via explicit calculations of memory usage and communication volume. CTF employs a general redistribution kernel, which transposes tensors of any dimension between arbitrary distributed layouts, yet touches each piece of data only once. Sequential symmetric contractions are reduced to matrix multiplication calls via tensor index transpositions and partial unpacking. The user-level interface elegantly expresses arbitrary-dimensional generalized tensor contractions in the form of a domain specific language. We demonstrate performance of CC with single and double excitations on 8192 nodes of Blue Gene/Q and show that CTF outperforms NWChem on Cray XE6 supercomputers for benchmarked systems.},

abstract = "Abstract Precise calculation of molecular electronic wavefunctions by methods such as coupled-cluster requires the computation of tensor contractions, the cost of which has polynomial computational scaling with respect to the system and basis set sizes. Each contraction may be executed via matrix multiplication on a properly ordered and structured tensor. However, data transpositions are often needed to reorder the tensors for each contraction. Writing and optimizing distributed-memory kernels for each transposition and contraction is tedious since the number of contractions scales combinatorially with the number of tensor indices. We present a distributed-memory numerical library (Cyclops Tensor Framework (CTF)) that automatically manages tensor blocking and redistribution to perform any user-specified contractions. \{CTF\} serves as the distributed-memory contraction engine in Aquarius, a new program designed for high-accuracy and massively-parallel quantum chemical computations. Aquarius implements a range of coupled-cluster and related methods such as \{CCSD\} and \{CCSDT\} by writing the equations on top of a C++ templated domain-specific language. This \{DSL\} calls \{CTF\} directly to manage the data and perform the contractions. Our \{CCSD\} and \{CCSDT\} implementations achieve high parallel scalability on the BlueGene/Q and Cray \{XC30\} supercomputer architectures showing that accurate electronic structure calculations can be effectively carried out on top of general distributed-memory tensor primitives.

abstract = {The Advanced Concepts in Electronic Structure (ACES) III software is a completely rewritten implementation for parallel computer architectures of the most used capabilities in ACES II, including the calculation of the electronic structure of molecular ground states and excited states, and determination of molecular geometries and of vibrational frequencies using many-body and coupled cluster methods. To achieve good performance on modern parallel systems while simultaneously offering a software development environment that allows rapid implementation of new methods and algorithms, ACES III was written using a new software infrastructure, the super instruction architecture comprising a domain-specific language, super instruction assembly language (SIAL), and a sophisticated runtime environment, super instruction processor (SIP). The architecture of ACES III is described as well as the inner workings of SIAL and SIP. The execution performance of ACES III and the productivity of programming in SIAL are discussed. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. WIREs Comput Mol Sci 2011 1 895–901 DOI:10.1002/wcms.77},

    abstract = { We have developed a symbolic manipulation program and program generator (tensor contraction engine or TCE) that abstracts and automates the time-consuming, error-prone processes of deriving the working equations of a well-defined model of second-quantized many-electron theories and synthesizing efficient parallel computer programs on the basis of these equations. Provided an ansatz of a many-electron theory model, TCE performs valid contractions of creation and annihilation operators according to Wick's theorem, consolidates identical terms, and reduces the expressions into the form of multiple tensor contractions acted upon by permutation operators. It subsequently determines the binary contraction order for each multiple tensor contraction with the minimal operation and memory cost, factorizes common binary contractions (defines intermediate tensors), and identifies reusable intermediates. The resulting ordered list of binary tensor contractions, additions, and index permutations is translated into an optimized program that is combined with the NWCHEM and UTCHEM computational chemistry software packages. The programs synthesized by TCE take advantage of spin symmetry (within the spin−orbital formalisms), real Abelian point-group symmetry, and index permutation symmetry at every stage of the calculations to minimize the number of arithmetic operations and storage requirement, adjust the peak local memory usage by index-range tiling, and support parallel I/O interfaces and dynamic load balancing for parallel executions. We demonstrate the utility of TCE through automatic derivation and implementation of parallel programs for a range of predictive computational methodsconfiguration-interaction theory (CISD, CISDT, CISDTQ), generalized many-body perturbation theory [MBPT(2), MBPT(3), MBPT(4)], and coupled-cluster theory (LCCD, CCD, LCCSD, CCSD, QCISD, CCSDT, and CCSDTQ), some for the first timeand discuss the performance of the implemented programs. }

    abstract = { We propose to construct electron correlation methods that are scalable in both molecule size and aggregated parallel computational power, in the sense that the total elapsed time of a calculation becomes nearly independent of the molecular size when the number of processors grows linearly with the molecular size. This is shown to be possible by exploiting a combination of local approximations and parallel algorithms. The concept is demonstrated with a linear scaling pair natural orbital local second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (PNO-LMP2) method. In this method, both the wave function manifold and the integrals are transformed incrementally from projected atomic orbitals (PAOs) first to orbital-specific virtuals (OSVs) and finally to pair natural orbitals (PNOs), which allow for minimum domain sizes and fine-grained accuracy control using very few parameters. A parallel algorithm design is discussed, which is efficient for both small and large molecules, and numbers of processors, although true inverse-linear scaling with compute power is not yet reached in all cases. Initial applications to reactions involving large molecules reveal surprisingly large effects of dispersion energy contributions as well as large intramolecular basis set superposition errors in canonical MP2 calculations. In order to account for the dispersion effects, the usual selection of PNOs on the basis of natural occupation numbers turns out to be insufficient, and a new energy-based criterion is proposed. If explicitly correlated (F12) terms are included, fast convergence to the MP2 complete basis set (CBS) limit is achieved. For the studied reactions, the PNO-LMP2-F12 results deviate from the canonical MP2/CBS and MP2-F12 values by <1 kJ mol–1, using triple-ζ (VTZ-F12) basis sets. }

    abstract = { We present an efficient explicitly correlated pair natural orbital local second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (PNO-LMP2-F12) method. The method is an extension of our previously reported PNO-LMP2 approach [Werner et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2015, 11, 484]. Near linear scaling with the size of molecule is achieved by using domain approximations on both virtual and occupied orbitals, local density fitting (DF), and local resolution of the identity (RI), and by exploiting the sparsity of the local molecular orbitals (LMOs) as well as of projected atomic orbitals (PAOs). All large data structures used in the method are stored in distributed memory using Global Arrays (GAs) to achieve near inverse-linear scaling with the number of processing cores, provided that the GAs can be efficiently and independently accessed from all cores. The effect of the various domain approximations is tested for a wide range of chemical reactions. The PNO-LMP2-F12 reaction energies deviate from the canonical DF-MP2-F12 results by ≤1 kJ mol–1 using triple-ζ (VTZ-F12) basis sets and are close to the complete basis set limits. PNO-LMP2-F12 calculations on molecules of chemical interest involving a few thousand basis functions can be performed within an hour or less using a few nodes on a small computer cluster. }

In contrast to the previous approach based on projected atomic orbitals {(PAOs),} described by Schu\&\#x308;tz {[J.} Chem. Phys. 113, 9986 (2000)], the new scheme works without any ad hoc truncations of the virtual space to domains. A single threshold defines the pair and triple specific virtual spaces completely and automatically. It is demonstrated that the computational cost of the method scales linearly with molecular size. Employing the recommended threshold a similar fraction of the correlation energy is recovered as with the original {PAO} method at a somewhat lower cost. A benchmark for 52 reactions demonstrates that for reaction energies the intrinsic accuracy of the coupled cluster with singles and doubles excitations and a perturbative treatment of triples excitations method can be reached by {OSV-local} coupled cluster theory with singles and doubles and perturbative triples, provided a {MP2} correction is applied that accounts for basis set incompleteness errors as well as for remaining domain errors. As an application example the interaction energies of the guanine-cytosine dimers in the {Watson-Crick} and stacked arrangements are investigated at the level of local coupled cluster theory with singles and doubles and perturbative triples. Based on these calculations we propose new complete-basis-set-limit estimates for these interaction energies at this level of theory.},

The local exchange approximation is used, but the usual muffin-tin approximation for potentials or densities is avoided. Procedures specifically optimized for treating large systems, such as transition-metal complexes, are developed. Some illustrative results are given for small molecules. We show that one-electron energies can be calculated rapidly and that the charge distribution is also easily obtained. Total energies, and therefore optim- ized molecular geometries, require more computation time."

Including only double substitutions, the computed upper bound for the ground state is 0.0631 a.u. above the experimental non-relativistic value. An approximate treatment of unlinked clusters lowers the energy by 0.0145 a.u. Thus above 90$%$ of the total correlation energy is accounted for. The computed vertical ionization energies (IE's) agree with experiment to within 2$%$. An analysis of the IE's shows the causes of anomalous behavior of correlation energies and supports a suggestion for useful limited CI calculations of vertical IE's. The equilibrium geometries of the three lowest states of the ion are determined by SCF calculations and estimates for the adiabatic IE's are given.}

  abstract={The "chain of spheres" {(COS)} algorithm, as part of the {RIJCOSX} {SCF} procedure, approximates the exchange term by performing analytic integration with respect to the coordinates of only one of the two electrons, whereas for the remaining coordinates, integration is carried out numerically. In the present work, we attempt to enhance the efficiency of the method by minimizing numerical errors in the {COS} procedure. The main idea is based on the work of Friesner and consists of finding a fitting matrix, Q, which leads the numerical and analytically evaluated overlap matrices to coincide. Using Q, the evaluation of exchange integrals can indeed be improved. Improved results and timings are obtained with the present default grid setup for both single point calculations and geometry optimizations. The fitting procedure results in a reduction of grid sizes necessary for achieving chemical accuracy. We demonstrate this by testing a number of grids and comparing results to the fully analytic and the earlier {COS} approximations. This turns out to be favourable for total and reaction energies, for which chemical accuracy can now be reached with a corresponding {\textasciitilde}30\% speedup over the original {RIJCOSX} procedure for single point energies. Results are slightly less favourable for the accuracy of geometry optimizations, but the procedure is still shown to yield geometries with errors well below the method inherent errors of the employed theoretical framework.},

  abstract={In this paper, the possibility is explored to speed up {Hartree–Fock} and hybrid density functional calculations by forming the Coulomb and exchange parts of the Fock matrix by different approximations. For the Coulomb part the previously introduced {Split-RI-J} variant {(F.} Neese, J. Comput. Chem. 24 (2003) 1740) of the well-known ‘density fitting’ approximation is used. The exchange part is formed by semi-numerical integration techniques that are closely related to Friesner’s pioneering pseudo-spectral approach. Our potentially linear scaling realization of this algorithm is called the ‘chain-of-spheres exchange’ {(COSX).} A combination of semi-numerical integration and density fitting is also proposed. Both {Split-RI-J} and {COSX} scale very well with the highest angular momentum in the basis sets. It is shown that for extended basis sets speed-ups of up to two orders of magnitude compared to traditional implementations can be obtained in this way. Total energies are reproduced with an average error of {\textless}0.3kcal/mol as determined from extended test calculations with various basis sets on a set of 26 molecules with 20–200 atoms and up to 2000 basis functions. Reaction energies agree to within 0.2kcal/mol {(Hartree–Fock)} or 0.05kcal/mol (hybrid {DFT)} with the canonical values. The {COSX} algorithm parallelizes with a speedup of 8.6 observed for 10 processes. Minimum energy geometries differ by less than 0.3pm in the bond distances and 0.5{\textdegree} in the bond angels from their canonical values. These developments enable highly efficient and accurate self-consistent field calculations including nonlocal {Hartree–Fock} exchange for large molecules. In combination with the {RI-MP2} method and large basis sets, second-order many body perturbation energies can be obtained for medium sized molecules with unprecedented efficiency. The algorithms are implemented into the {ORCA} electronic structure system.},

    abstract = { We present a quantum chemistry benchmark database for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions (GMTKN24). It is an unprecedented compilation of 24 different, chemically relevant subsets that either are taken from already existing databases or are presented here for the first time. The complete set involves a total of 1.049 atomic and molecular single point calculations and comprises 731 data points (relative chemical energies) based on accurate theoretical or experimental reference values. The usefulness of the GMTKN24 database is shown by applying common density functionals on the (meta-)generalized gradient approximation (GGA), hybrid-GGA, and double-hybrid-GGA levels to it, including an empirical London dispersion correction. Furthermore, we refitted the functional parameters of four (meta-)GGA functionals based on a fit set containing 143 systems, comprising seven chemically different problems. Validation against the GMTKN24 and the molecular structure (bond lengths) databases shows that the reparameterization does not change bond lengths much, whereas the description of energetic properties is more prone to the parameters’ values. The empirical dispersion correction also often improves for conventional thermodynamic problems and makes a functional’s performance more uniform over the entire database. The refitted functionals typically have a lower mean absolute deviation for the majority of subsets in the proposed GMTKN24 set. This, however, is also often accompanied at the expense of poor performance for a few other important subsets. Thus, creating a broadly applicable (and overall better) functional by just reparameterizing existing ones seems to be difficult. Nevertheless, this benchmark study reveals that a reoptimized (i.e., empirical) version of the TPSS-D functional (oTPSS-D) performs well for a variety of problems and may meet the standards of an improved functional. We propose validation against this new compilation of benchmark sets as a definitive way to evaluate a new quantum chemical method’s true performance. }

    abstract = { We present a number of near-exact, nonrelativistic, Born−Oppenheimer reference data sets for the parametrization of more approximate methods (such as DFT functionals). The data were obtained by means of the W4 ab initio computational thermochemistry protocol, which has a 95\% confidence interval well below 1 kJ/mol. Our data sets include W4-08, which are total atomization energies of over 100 small molecules that cover varying degrees of nondynamical correlations, and DBH24-W4, which are W4 theory values for Truhlar’s set of 24 representative barrier heights. The usual procedure of comparing calculated DFT values with experimental atomization energies is hampered by comparatively large experimental uncertainties in many experimental values and compounds errors due to deficiencies in the DFT functional with those resulting from neglect of relativity and finite nuclear mass. Comparison with accurate, explicitly nonrelativistic, ab initio data avoids these issues. We then proceed to explore the performance of B2x-PLYP-type double hybrid functionals for atomization energies and barrier heights. We find that the optimum hybrids for hydrogen-transfer reactions, heavy-atoms transfers, nucleophilic substitutions, and unimolecular and recombination reactions are quite different from one another: out of these subsets, the heavy-atom transfer reactions are by far the most sensitive to the percentages of Hartree−Fock-type exchange y and MP2-type correlation x in an (x, y) double hybrid. The (42,72) hybrid B2K-PLYP, as reported in a preliminary communication, represents the best compromise between thermochemistry and hydrogen-transfer barriers, while also yielding excellent performance for nucleophilic substitutions. By optimizing for best overall performance on both thermochemistry and the DBH24-W4 data set, however, we find a new (36,65) hybrid which we term B2GP-PLYP. At a slight expense in performance for hydrogen-transfer barrier heights and nucleophilic substitutions, we obtain substantially better performance for the other reaction types. Although both B2K-PLYP and B2GP-PLYP are capable of 2 kcal/mol quality thermochemistry, B2GP-PLYP appears to be the more robust toward nondynamical correlation and strongly polar character. We additionally find that double-hybrid functionals display excellent performance for such problems as hydrogen bonding, prototype late transition metal reactions, pericyclic reactions, prototype cumulene−polyacetylene system, and weak interactions. }

This work is an extension of the earlier developed {LPNO} coupled-electron pair approximation {(LNPO-CEPA)} method {[F.} Neese et al., Chem. Phys. 130, 114108 (2009)] and makes extended use of the resolution of the identity {(RI)} or density fitting {(DF)} approximation. Two variants of each method are compared. The less accurate approximations {(LPNO2-QCISD/LPNO2-CCSD)} still recover 98.7\%-99.3\% of the correlation energy in the given basis and have modest disk space requirements. The more accurate variants {(LPNO1-QCISD/LPNO1-CCSD)} typically recover 99.75\%-99.95\% of the correlation energy in the given basis but require the Coulomb and exchange operators with up to two-external indices to be stored on disk. Both variants have comparable computational efficiency. The convergence of the results with respect to the natural orbital truncation parameter {(T(CutPNO))} has been studied. Extended numerical tests have been performed on absolute and relative correlation energies as function of basis set size and {T(CutPNO)} as well as on reaction energies, isomerization energies, and weak intermolecular interactions. The results indicate that the errors of the {LPNO} methods compared to the canonical {QCISD} and {CCSD} methods are below 1 kcal/mol with our default thresholds. Finally, some calculations on larger molecules are reported (ranging from 40-86 atoms) and it is shown that for medium sized molecules the total wall clock time required to complete the {LPNO-CCSD} calculations is only two to four times that of the preceding self-consistent field {(SCF).} Thus these methods are highly suitable for large-scale computational chemistry applications. Since there are only three thresholds involved that have been given conservative default values, the methods can be confidentially used in a {"}black-box{"} fashion in the same way as their canonical counterparts.},

  abstract={Coupled-electron pair approximations {(CEPAs)} and coupled-pair functionals {(CPFs)} have been popular in the 1970s and 1980s and have yielded excellent results for small molecules. Recently, interest in {CEPA} and {CPF} methods has been renewed. It has been shown that these methods lead to competitive thermochemical, kinetic, and structural predictions. They greatly surpass second order {Moller-Plesset} and popular density functional theory based approaches in accuracy and are intermediate in quality between {CCSD} and {CCSD(T)} in extended benchmark studies. In this work an efficient production level implementation of the closed shell {CEPA} and {CPF} methods is reported that can be applied to medium sized molecules in the range of 50-100 atoms and up to about 2000 basis functions. The internal space is spanned by localized internal orbitals. The external space is greatly compressed through the method of pair natural orbitals {(PNOs)} that was also introduced by the pioneers of the {CEPA} approaches. Our implementation also makes extended use of density fitting (or resolution of the identity) techniques in order to speed up the laborious integral transformations. The method is called local pair natural orbital {CEPA} {(LPNO-CEPA)} {(LPNO-CPF).} The implementation is centered around the concepts of electron pairs and matrix operations. Altogether three cutoff parameters are introduced that control the size of the significant pair list, the average number of {PNOs} per electron pair, and the number of contributing basis functions per {PNO.} With the conservatively chosen default values of these thresholds, the method recovers about 99.8\% of the canonical correlation energy. This translates to absolute deviations from the canonical result of only a few kcal mol(-1). Extended numerical test calculations demonstrate that {LPNO-CEPA} {(LPNO-CPF)} has essentially the same accuracy as parent {CEPA} {(CPF)} methods for thermochemistry, kinetics, weak interactions, and potential energy surfaces but is up to 500 times faster. The method performs best in conjunction with large and flexible basis sets. These results open the way for large-scale chemical applications.},

  abstract={Domain based local pair natural orbital coupled clustertheory with single-, double-, and perturbative triple excitations {(DLPNO-CCSD(T))} is a highly efficient local correlation method. It is known to be accurate and robust and can be used in a black box fashion in order to obtain coupled cluster quality total energies for large molecules with several hundred atoms. While previous implementations showed near linear scaling up to a few hundred atoms, several nonlinear scaling steps limited the applicability of the method for very large systems. In this work, these limitations are overcome and a linear scaling {DLPNO-CCSD(T)} method for closed shell systems is reported. The new implementation is based on the concept of sparse maps that was introduced in Part I of this series {[P.} Pinski, C. Riplinger, E. F. Valeev, and F. Neese, J. Chem. Phys. 143, 034108 (2015)]. Using the sparse map infrastructure, all essential computational steps (integral transformation and storage, initial guess, pair natural orbital construction, amplitude iterations, triples correction) are achieved in a linear scaling fashion. In addition, a number of additional algorithmic improvements are reported that lead to significant speedups of the method. The new, linear-scaling {DLPNO-CCSD(T)} implementation typically is 7 times faster than the previous implementation and consumes 4 times less disk space for large three-dimensional systems. For linear systems, the performance gains and memory savings are substantially larger. Calculations with more than 20 000 basis functions and 1000 atoms are reported in this work. In all cases, the time required for the coupled cluster step is comparable to or lower than for the preceding {Hartree-Fock} calculation, even if this is carried out with the efficient resolution-of-the-identity and chain-of-spheres approximations. The new implementation even reduces the error in absolute correlation energies by about a factor of two, compared to the already accurate previous implementation.},

  abstract={In this work, the extension of the previously developed domain based local pair-natural orbital {(DLPNO)} based singles- and doubles coupled cluster {(DLPNO-CCSD)} method to perturbatively include connected triple excitations is reported. The development is based on the concept of triples-natural orbitals that span the joint space of the three pair natural orbital {(PNO)} spaces of the three electron pairs that are involved in the calculation of a given triple-excitation contribution. The truncation error is very smooth and can be significantly reduced through extrapolation to the zero threshold. However, the extrapolation procedure does not improve relative energies. The overall computational effort of the method is asymptotically linear with the system size {O(N).} Actual linear scaling has been confirmed in test calculations on alkane chains. The accuracy of the {DLPNO-CCSD(T)} approximation relative to semicanonical {CCSD(T0)} is comparable to the previously developed {DLPNO-CCSD} method relative to canonical {CCSD.} Relative energies are predicted with an average error of approximately 0.5 kcal\&\#x2215;mol for a challenging test set of medium sized organic molecules. The triples correction typically adds 30\%-50\% to the overall computation time. Thus, very large systems can be treated on the basis of the current implementation.

  abstract={In previous publications, it was shown that an efficient local coupled cluster method with single- and double excitations can be based on the concept of pair natural orbitals {(PNOs)} {[F.} Neese, A. Hansen, and D. G. Liakos, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 064103 (2009)]. The resulting local pair natural orbital-coupled-cluster single double {(LPNO-CCSD)} method has since been proven to be highly reliable and efficient. For large molecules, the number of amplitudes to be determined is reduced by a factor of 10(5)-10(6) relative to a canonical {CCSD} calculation on the same system with the same basis set. In the original method, the {PNOs} were expanded in the set of canonical virtual orbitals and single excitations were not truncated. This led to a number of fifth order scaling steps that eventually rendered the method computationally expensive for large molecules (e.g., \&gt;100 atoms). In the present work, these limitations are overcome by a complete redesign of the {LPNO-CCSD} method. The new method is based on the combination of the concepts of {PNOs} and projected atomic orbitals {(PAOs).} Thus, each {PNO} is expanded in a set of {PAOs} that in turn belong to a given electron pair specific domain. In this way, it is possible to fully exploit locality while maintaining the extremely high compactness of the original {LPNO-CCSD} wavefunction. No terms are dropped from the {CCSD} equations and domains are chosen conservatively. The correlation energy loss due to the domains remains below \&lt;0.05\%, which implies typically 15-20 but occasionally up to 30 atoms per domain on average. The new method has been given the acronym {DLPNO-CCSD} ({"}domain based {LPNO-CCSD{"}).} The method is nearly linear scaling with respect to system size. The original {LPNO-CCSD} method had three adjustable truncation thresholds that were chosen conservatively and do not need to be changed for actual applications. In the present treatment, no additional truncation parameters have been introduced. Any additional truncation is performed on the basis of the three original thresholds. There are no real-space cutoffs. Single excitations are truncated using singles-specific natural orbitals. Pairs are prescreened according to a multipole expansion of a pair correlation energy estimate based on local orbital specific virtual orbitals {(LOSVs).} Like its {LPNO-CCSD} predecessor, the method is completely of black box character and does not require any user adjustments. It is shown here that {DLPNO-CCSD} is as accurate as {LPNO-CCSD} while leading to computational savings exceeding one order of magnitude for larger systems. The largest calculations reported here featured \&gt;8800 basis functions and \&gt;450 atoms. In all larger test calculations done so far, the {LPNO-CCSD} step took less time than the preceding {Hartree-Fock} calculation, provided no approximations have been introduced in the latter. Thus, based on the present development reliable {CCSD} calculations on large molecules with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy are realized.},

With a [5s4p3d2f1g] basis set, the \{CCSD\} (T) method predicts the bent (cyclic) 2B2 state to lie 6.8 kcal/mol lower than the linear 2Σ+u species. The importance of correlation effects included at the \{CCSD\} (T) level of theory is analyzed in connection to the existence of symmetry-broken Hartree—Fock solutions for this problem. "

  abstract={In this paper, we present a comprehensive account of an explicitly spin-free compact state-universal multireference coupled cluster {(CC)} formalism for computing the state energies of simple open-shell systems, e.g., doublets and biradicals, where the target open-shell states can be described by a few configuration state functions spanning a model space. The cluster operators in this formalism are defined in terms of the spin-free unitary generators with respect to the common closed-shell component of all model functions (core) as vacuum. The spin-free cluster operators are either closed-shell-like n hole-n particle excitations (denoted by T(mu)) or involve excitations from the doubly occupied (nonvalence) orbitals to the singly occupied (valence) orbitals (denoted by S(e)(mu)). In addition, there are cluster operators with exchange spectator scatterings involving the valence orbitals (denoted by S(re)(mu)). We propose a new multireference cluster expansion ansatz for the wave operator with the above generally noncommuting cluster operators which essentially has the same physical content as the {Jeziorski-Monkhorst} ansatz with the commuting cluster operators defined in the spin-orbital basis. The T(mu) operators in our ansatz are taken to commute with all other operators, while the S(e)(mu) and S(re)(mu) operators are allowed to contract among themselves through the spectator valence orbitals. An important innovation of this ansatz is the choice of an appropriate automorphic factor accompanying each contracted composite of cluster operators in order to ensure that each distinct excitation generated by this composite appears only once in the wave operator. The resulting {CC} equations consist of two types of terms: a {"}direct{"} term and a {"}normalization{"} term containing the effective Hamiltonian operator. It is emphasized that the direct term is almost quartic in the cluster amplitudes, barring only a handful of terms and termination of the normalization term depends on the valence rank of the effective Hamiltonian operator and the excitation rank of the cluster operators at which the theory is truncated. Illustrative applications are presented by computing the state energies of neutral doublet radicals and doublet molecular cations and ionization energies of neutral molecules and comparing our results with the other open-shell {CC} theories, benchmark full {CI} results (when available) in the same basis, and the experimental results. Highly encouraging results show the efficacy of the method.},

  abstract={A production level implementation of the high-spin open-shell (spin unrestricted) single reference coupled pair, quadratic configuration interaction and coupled cluster methods with up to doubly excited determinants in the framework of the local pair natural orbital {(LPNO)} concept is reported. This work is an extension of the closed-shell {LPNO} methods developed earlier {[F.} Neese, F. Wennmohs, and A. Hansen, J. Chem. Phys. 130, 114108 (2009); F. Neese, A. Hansen, and D. G. Liakos, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 064103 (2009)]. The internal space is spanned by localized orbitals, while the external space for each electron pair is represented by a truncated {PNO} expansion. The laborious integral transformation associated with the large number of {PNOs} becomes feasible through the extensive use of density fitting (resolution of the identity {(RI))} techniques. Technical complications arising for the open-shell case and the use of quasi-restricted orbitals for the construction of the reference determinant are discussed in detail. As in the closed-shell case, only three cutoff parameters control the average number of {PNOs} per electron pair, the size of the significant pair list, and the number of contributing auxiliary basis functions per {PNO.} The chosen threshold default values ensure robustness and the results of the parent canonical methods are reproduced to high accuracy. Comprehensive numerical tests on absolute and relative energies as well as timings consistently show that the outstanding performance of the {LPNO} methods carries over to the open-shell case with minor modifications. Finally, hyperfine couplings calculated with the variational {LPNO-CEPA\&\#x2215;1} method, for which a well-defined expectation value type density exists, indicate the great potential of the {LPNO} approach for the efficient calculation of molecular properties.},

The perturbation approach originally introduced by M{\o}ller and Plesset, terminated at finite order, is found to satisfy most of these requirements. It is size consistent, that is, applicable to an ensemble of isolated systems in an additive manner. On the other hand, it does not provide an upper bound for the electronic energy. The independent electron-pair approximation is accurate to second order in a {M{\o}ller-Plesset} expansion, but inaccurate in third order. A series of variational methods is discussed which gives upper bounds for the energy, but which lacks size consistency. Finally, calculations on some small molecules using a moderately large Gaussian basis are presented to illustrate these points. Equilibrium geometries, dissociation energies, and energy separations between electronic states of different spin multiplicities are described substantially better by {Moller-Plesset} theory to second or third order than by {Hartree-Fock} theory.},

  volume={128},
  number={31},

  year={2006},
  abstract={This work reports the evaluation of several theoretical approaches to the zero-field splitting {(ZFS)} in transition metal complexes. The experimentally well-known complex {[Mn(acac)3]} is taken as an example. The direct spin-spin contributions to the {ZFS} have been calculated on the basis of density functional theory {(DFT)} or complete active space self-consistent field {(CASSCF)} wave functions and have been found to be much more important than previously assumed. The contributions of the direct term may exceed approximately 1 cm(-1) in magnitude and therefore cannot be neglected in any treatment that aims at a realistic quantitative modeling of the {ZFS.} In the {DFT} framework, two different variants to treat the spin-orbit coupling {(SOC)} term have been evaluated. The first approach is based on previous work by Pederson, Khanna, and Kortus, and the second is based on a {"}quasi-restricted{"} {DFT} treatment which is rooted in our previous work on {ZFS.} Both approaches provide very similar results and underestimate the {SOC} contribution to the {ZFS} by a factor of 2 or more. The {SOC} is represented by an accurate multicenter spin-orbit mean-field {(SOMF)} approximation which is compared to the popular effective {DFT} potential-derived {SOC} operator. In addition to the {DFT} results, direct {"}infinite order{"} ab initio calculations of the {SOC} contribution to the {ZFS} based on {CASSCF} wave functions, the spectroscopy-oriented configuration interaction {(SORCI),} and the difference-dedicated {CI} {(DDCI)} approach are reported. In general, the multireference ab initio results provide a more realistic description of the {ZFS} in {[Mn(acac)3].} The conclusions likely carry over to many other systems. This is attributed to the explicit treatment of the multiplet effects which are of dominant importance, since the calculations demonstrate that, even in the high-spin d4 system {MnIII,} the spin-flip excitations make the largest contribution to the {SOC.} It is demonstrated that the ab initio methods can be used even for somewhat larger molecules (the present calculations were done with more than 500 basis functions) in a reasonable time frame. Much more economical but still fairly reasonable results have been achieved with the {INDO/S} treatment based on {CASSCF} and {SOC-CI} wave functions.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present an efficient implementation of general tensor contractions, which is part of a new coupled-cluster program. The tensor contractions, used to evaluate the residuals in each coupled-cluster iteration are particularly important for the performance of the program. We developed a generic procedure, which carries out contractions of two tensors irrespective of their explicit structure. It can handle coupled-cluster-type expressions of arbitrary excitation level. To make the contraction efficient without loosing flexibility, we use a three-step procedure. First, the data contained in the tensors are rearranged into matrices, then a matrix-matrix multiplication is performed, and finally the result is backtransformed to a tensor. The current implementation is significantly more efficient than previous ones capable of treating arbitrary high excitations.},

  volume={134},
  number={12},
  pages={124106},
  year={2011},
  abstract={In this article we report on the coupled-cluster factorization problem. We describe the first implementation that optimizes (i) the contraction order for each term, (ii) the identification of reusable intermediates, (iii) the selection and factoring out of common factors simultaneously, considering all projection levels in a single step. The optimization is achieved by means of a genetic algorithm. Taking a one-term-at-a-time strategy as reference our factorization yields speedups of up to 4 (for intermediate excitation levels, smaller basis sets). We derive a theoretical lower bound for the highest order scaling cost and show that it is met by our implementation. Additionally, we report on the performance of the resulting highly excited coupled-cluster algorithms and find significant improvements with respect to the implementation of {K\&\#xE1;llay} and {Surj\&\#xE1;n} {[J.} Chem. Phys. 115, 2945 (2001)] and comparable performance with respect to {MOLPRO's} handwritten and dedicated open shell coupled cluster with singles and doubles substitutions implementation {[P.} J.

  abstract = {A formulation of MP2-R12 theory is presented leading to simplified matrix elements in the R12 part. The resulting formulas are free from the integrals over the commutator of the kinetic operator with inter-electronic distance, which means a substantial decreasing of the computational demands. The use of an auxiliary basis set for the resolution of identity is discussed. First results using the standard approximation are compared with the former variants of MP2-R12 for CH2, CH4, NH3, H2O, HF, CO, CH3OH, N2, and F2. The results show that the new formulation is not only less demanding, but also preferred concerning the convergence properties toward the basis set limit. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract  ="We propose to account for the large basis-set error of a conventional coupled-cluster energy and wave function by a simple perturbative correction. The perturbation expansion is constructed by Lowdin partitioning of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian in a space that includes explicitly correlated basis functions. To test this idea{,} we investigate the second-order explicitly correlated correction to the coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) energy{,} denoted here as the CCSD(2)R12 method. The proposed perturbation expansion presents a systematic and easy-to-interpret picture of the {"}interference{"} between the basis-set and correlation hierarchies in the many-body electronic-structure theory. The leading-order term in the energy correction is the amplitude-independent R12 correction from the standard second-order Moller-Plesset R12 method. The cluster amplitudes appear in the higher-order terms and their effect is to decrease the basis-set correction{,} in accordance with the usual experience. In addition to the use of the standard R12 technology which simplifies all matrix elements to at most two-electron integrals{,} we propose several optional approximations to select only the most important terms in the energy correction. For a limited test set{,} the valence CCSD energies computed with the approximate method{,} termed {,} are on average precise to (1.9{,} 1.4{,} 0.5 and 0.1$%$) when computed with Dunning{'}s aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets [X = (D{,} T{,} Q{,} 5)] accompanied by a single Slater-type correlation factor. This precision is a roughly an order of magnitude improvement over the standard CCSD method{,} whose respective average basis-set errors are (28.2{,} 10.6{,} 4.4 and 2.1$%$). Performance of the method is almost identical to that of the more complex iterative counterpart{,} CCSD(R12). The proposed approach to explicitly correlated coupled-cluster methods is technically appealing since no modification of the coupled-cluster equations is necessary and the standard Moller-Plesset R12 machinery can be reused."}

  abstract={Internally contracted multireference coupled cluster {(ic-MRCC)} methods with perturbative treatment of triple excitations are formulated based on Dyall's definition of a zeroth-order Hamiltonian. The iterative models {ic-MRCCSDT-1,} {ic-MRCC3,} and their variants {ic-MRCCSD(T),} {ic-MRCC(3)} which determine the energy correction from triples by a non-iterative step are consistent in the single-reference limit with {CCSDT-1a,} {CC3,} {CCSD(T),} and {CC(3),} respectively. Numerical tests on the potential energy surfaces of {BeH(2),} {H(2)O,} and N(2) as well as on the structure and harmonic vibrational frequencies of the ozone molecule show that these methods account very well for higher order correlation effects. The {ic-MRCCSD(T)} method is further applied to the geometry optimization and harmonic frequencies of the symmetric vibrational modes of the binuclear transition metal oxide {Ni(2)O(2),} to the singlet-triplet splittings of o-, m-, and p-benzyne and to a ring-opening reaction of an azirine compound with the molecular formula {C(6)H(7)NO.} The size of the active spaces used in this study ranges from {CAS(2,2)} to {CAS(8,8).} Comparisons of results based on differently sized active spaces indicate that the {ic-MRCCSD(T)} method provides a highly accurate and efficient treatment of both static and dynamic electron correlation in connection with minimal active spaces.},

  abstract={The internally contracted multireference coupled cluster {(ic-MRCC)} approach is formulated using a new wave function ansatz based on a sequential transformation of the reference function {(sqic-MRCC).} This alternative wave function simplifies the formulation of computationally viable methods while preserving the accuracy of the {ic-MRCC} approach. The structure of the {sqic-MRCC} wave function allows folding the effect of the single excitations into a similarity-transformed Hamiltonian whose particle rank is equal to the one of the Hamiltonian. Consequently, we formulate an approximation to the {sqic-MRCC} method with singles and doubles (included respectively up to fourfold and twofold commutators, {sqic-MRCCSD[2])} that contains all terms present in the corresponding single-reference coupled cluster scheme. Computations of the potential energy curves for the dissociation of {BeH(2)} show that the untruncated {sqic-MRCCSD} scheme yields results that are almost indistinguishable from the ordinary {ic-MRCCSD} method. The energy obtained from the computationally less expensive {sqic-MRCCSD[2]} approximation is found to deviate from the full {ic-MRCCSD} method by less than 0.2 {mE(h)} for {BeH(2),} while, in the case of water, the harmonic vibrational frequencies of ozone, the singlet-triplet splitting of p-benzyne, and the dissociation curve of N(2), {sqic-MRCCSD[2]} faithfully reproduces the results obtained via the {ic-MRCCSD} scheme truncated to two commutators. A formal proof is given of the equivalence of the {ic-MRCC} and {sqic-MRCC} methods with the internally contracted and full configuration interaction approaches.},

  abstract={We have formulated and implemented an internally contracted multireference coupled cluster {(ic-MRCC)} approach aimed at solving two of the problems encountered in methods based on the {Jeziorski-Monkhorst} ansatz: (i) the scaling of the computational and memory costs with respect to the number of references, and (ii) the lack of invariance of the energy with respect to rotations among active orbitals. The {ic-MRCC} approach is based on a straightforward generalization of the single-reference coupled cluster ansatz in which an exponential operator is applied to a multiconfigurational wave function. The {ic-MRCC} method truncated to single and double excitations {(ic-MRCCSD)} yields very accurate potential energy curves in benchmark computations on the Be + H(2) insertion reaction, the dissociation of hydrogen fluoride, and the symmetric double dissociation of water. Approximations of the {ic-MRCC} theory in which the {Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff} expansion is truncated up to a given number of commutators are found to converge quickly to the full theory. In our tests, two commutators are sufficient to recover a total energy within 0.5 {mE(h)} of the full {ic-MRCCSD} method along the entire potential energy curve. A formal analysis shows that the {ic-MRCC} method is invariant with respect to rotation among active orbitals, and that the orthogonalization procedure used to produce the set of linearly independent excitation operators plays a crucial role in guaranteeing the invariance properties. The orbital invariance was confirmed in numerical tests. Moreover, approximated versions of the {ic-MRCC} theory based on a truncated {Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff} expansion, preserve the orbital invariance properties of the full theory.},

  abstract={A state-specific partially internally contracted multireference coupled cluster approach is presented for general complete active spaces with arbitrary number of active electrons. The dominant dynamical correlation is included via an exponential parametrization of internally contracted cluster operators ( {\&\#x302;T)} which excite electrons from a multideterminantal reference function. The remaining dynamical correlation and relaxation effects are included via a diagonalization of the transformed Hamiltonian \&\#x305;\&\#x124; =e(- {\&\#x302;T)H\&\#x302;e(} {\&\#x302;T)} in the multireference configuration interaction singles space in an uncontracted fashion. A new set of residual equations for determining the internally contracted cluster amplitudes is proposed. The second quantized matrix elements of \&\#x305;\&\#x124; , expressed using the extended normal ordering of Kutzelnigg and Mukherjee, are used as the residual equations without projection onto the excited configurations. These residual equations, referred to as the many-body residuals, do not have any near-singularity and thus, should allow one to solve all the amplitudes without discarding any. There are some relatively minor remaining convergence issues that may arise from an attempt to solve all the amplitudes and an initial analysis is provided in this paper. Applications to the bond-stretching potential energy surfaces for N(2), {CO,} and the low-lying electronic states of C(2) indicate clear improvements of the results using the many-body residuals over the conventional projected residual equations.},

  abstract={A multiconfigurational self-consistent field method based on the concept of generalized active space {(GAS)} is presented. {GAS} wave functions are obtained by defining an arbitrary number of active spaces with arbitrary occupation constraints. By a suitable choice of the {GAS} spaces, numerous ineffective configurations present in a large complete active space {(CAS)} can be removed, while keeping the important ones in the {CI} space. As a consequence, the {GAS} self-consistent field approach retains the accuracy of the {CAS} self-consistent field {(CASSCF)} ansatz and, at the same time, can deal with larger active spaces, which would be unaffordable at the {CASSCF} level. Test calculations on the Gd atom, Gd(2) molecule, and {oxoMn(salen)} complex are presented. They show that {GAS} wave functions achieve the same accuracy as {CAS} wave functions on systems that would be prohibitive at the {CAS} level.},

This is the first treatment of photosystem {II} beyond the single-electron picture of density functional theory. Our calculations support recent modifications to the structure determined by X-ray crystallography. We further identify multiple low-lying energy surfaces associated with the structural distortion seen using X-ray crystallography, highlighting multistate reactivity in the chemistry of the cluster. Direct determination of Mn spin-projections from our wavefunctions suggests that current candidates that have been recently distinguished using parameterized spin models should be reassessed. Through entanglement maps, we reveal rich information contained in the wavefunctions on bonding changes in the cycle.},

The current accuracy of these methods in the various systems is discussed, with special attention to potential sources of systematic errors. Thus, the review summarizes and tries to rationalize the key elements of {MR/MC} calculations, namely, the choice of the employed active space, especially the so-called double-shell effect that has already been recognized to be important in transition-metal-containing systems, and the impact of these elements on the spin-state energetics of heme species, as well as on the bonding mechanism of small molecules to the heme. It is shown that expansion of the {MC} wave function into one based on localized orbitals provides a compact and insightful view on some otherwise complex electronic structures. The effects of protein environment on the {MR/MC} results are summarized for the few available quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical {(QM/MM)} studies. Comparisons with corresponding {DFT} results are also made wherever available. Potential future directions are proposed.},

  abstract={A new coupled cluster model of the polarization propagator, denoted as {XCC2,} is presented. The {XCC2} approach employs time-independent coupled cluster theory of polarization propagators of Moszynski et al. {[Collect.} Czech. Chem. Commun., 2005, 70, 1109] and excitation operators from the time-dependent {(TD)} {CC2} method. The performance of {XCC2} was investigated by calculating static and dynamic dipole polarizabilities for a test set of over 20 molecules and comparing them with {TD-CCSD} results. The quality of {XCC2} dispersion coefficients for several noncovalent molecular complexes was also tested against the benchmark values. This numerical study reveals that the average percent error of {XCC2} is significantly reduced in comparison to the {TD-CC2} method (4-fold reduction for the mean polarizabilities and 2-fold reduction for anisotropic polarizabilities is observed). Since the computational requirements of both {XCC2} and {TD-CC2} methods are virtually the same, the new {XCC2} method can be viewed as a practical alternative for {TD-CC2} for property calculations, giving the second-order polarization propagators of {near-CCSD} quality in many cases, but retaining at the same time the lower computational cost of the {TD-CC2} model.},

  abstract={{Iron(IV)-oxo} porphyrin radical cations are observed intermediates in peroxidase and catalase enzymes, where they are known as Compound I species, and the putative oxidizing species in cytochrome P450 enzymes. In this work, we report kinetic studies of reactions of {iron(IV)-oxo} porphyrin radical cations that can be compared to reactions of other metal-oxo species. The {iron(IV)-oxo} radical cations studied were those produced from {5,10,15,20-tetramesitylporphryinato-iron(III)} perchlorate (1), {5,10,15,20-tetramesitylporphryinato-iron(III)} chloride (2), both in {CH(3)CN} solvent, and that from {5,10,15,20-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrinato-iron(III)} perchlorate (3) in {CH(2)Cl(2)} solvent. The substrates studied were alkenes and activated hydrocarbons diphenylmethane and ethylbenzene. For a given organic reductant, various {iron(IV)-oxo} porphyrin radical cations react in a relatively narrow kinetic range; typically the second-order rate constants vary by less than 1 order of magnitude for the oxidants studied here and the related oxidant {5,10,15,20-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrinato-iron(IV)-oxo} porphyrin radical cation in {CH(3)CN} solvent. Charge transfer in the transition states for epoxidation reactions of substituted styrenes by oxidants 1 and 2, rho(+) values of -1.9 and -0.9, respectively, mirrors results found previously for related species. Competition kinetic reactions with a catalytic amount of porphyrin {iron(III)} species and a terminal oxidant give relative rate constants for oxidations of competing substrates that are somewhat smaller than the ratios of absolute rate constants. Water in {CH(3)CN} solutions has an apparent modest stabilizing effect on oxidant 1 as indicated in slightly reduced rate constants for oxidation reactions. The {iron(IV)-oxo} porphyrin radical cations are orders of magnitude less reactive than {porphyrin-manganese(V)-oxo} cations and a {corrole-iron(V)-oxo} species. The small environment effects found here suggest that high energy demanding hydrocarbon oxidation reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes might require highly reactive {iron(V)-oxo} transients as oxidants instead of the more stable, isomeric {iron(IV)-oxo} porphyrin radical cations.},

Mass spectrometry, Mössbauer, electron paramagnetic resonance, and x-ray absorption spectroscopies, as well as reactivity studies and density functional theory calculations show that this long-lived (hours at –60°C) intermediate is a spin S = 1/2 iron(V)-oxo complex. Iron-TAML systems have proven to be efficient catalysts in the decomposition of numerous pollutants by hydrogen peroxide, and the species we characterized is a likely reactive intermediate in these reactions.},

Complexes 3 a and 4 a were characterized by {IR} and elemental analysis, and complex 3 a also by X-ray crystallography. Nonheme {iron(III)} complexes 3, 3 a, 4, and 4 a catalyze olefin epoxidation and alcohol oxidation on treatment with m-chloroperbenzoic acid. Pairwise comparisons of the reactivity of these complexes revealed that the nature of the axial ligand {(Cl(-)} versus {H(2)O)} influences the yield of oxidation products, whereas an electronic change in the supporting chelate ligand has little effect. Hydrocarbon oxidation by these catalysts was proposed to involve an {iron(V)} oxo species which is formed on heterolytic {O-O} bond cleavage of an iron acylperoxo intermediate {(FeOOC(O)R).} Evidence for this {iron(V)} oxo species was derived from {KIE} {(k(H)/k(D))} values, H(2) {(18)O} exchange experiments, and the use of peroxyphenylacetic acid {(PPAA)} as the peracid. Our results suggest that an {Fe(V)=O} moiety can form in a system wherein the supporting chelate ligand comprises a mixture of neutral and anionic nitrogen donors. This work is relevant to the chemistry of mononuclear nonheme iron enzymes that are proposed to oxidize organic substrates via reaction pathways involving high-valent iron oxo species.},

The systems studied were 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin {(TPP),} 5,10,15,20-tetramesitylporphyrin {(TMP),} and 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethylporphyrin {(OEP).} The new species, which decayed within milliseconds in acetonitrile solutions, were shown to react with organic substrates by oxo-transfer reactions involving insertions into carbon-carbon double bonds of alkenes and styrenes or benzylic carbon-hydrogen bonds of arenes. The order of reactivity was {OEP} \&gt; {TPP} \&gt; {TMP.} Second-order rate constants for reactions with several substrates at 22 degrees C were determined; representative values of rate constants for the {TPP} derivative were k = 8.6 x 10(5) M(-1) s(-1) for styrene, k = 2.5 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) for cyclohexene, and k = 7.7 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1) for ethylbenzene. These porphyrin-iron-oxo transients reacted 4-5 orders of magnitude faster than the corresponding {iron(IV)-oxo} porphyrin radical cations with rate constants similar to those of {porphyrin-manganese(V)-oxo} derivatives. Rate constants for oxidations of benzylic {C-H} positions of arenes correlated with the {C-H} bond dissociation energies, and Hammett correlations for reactions with substituted styrenes had rho(+) values ranging from -0.5 to -0.7, reflecting electrophilic character of the oxidants and their high reactivity. On the basis of their unique {UV-visible} spectra, high reactivities, and oxo-transfer properties, the new transients are tentatively identified as {porphyrin-iron(V)-oxo} perchlorates, electronic isomers (or valence tautomers) of well-known {iron(IV)-oxo} porphyrin radical cations.},

In this mini-review, the milestones in discovering Compound I of cytochrome P450 are summarized. It will be discussed what was known and suggested in the years before 1984, the year when Klaus Ruckpaul's first book about cytochrome P450 appeared, and compared with recent approaches and studies to catch and characterize this intermediate oxygen species in the reaction cycle of cytochrome P450. Although many studies have been undertaken before and after 1984 to characterize Compound I, its electronic structure and physicochemical properties are still a mystery. The conclusion from this review is that the knowledge about Compound I has significantly increased; however, we still ask the same questions. There is a need for improved experimental approaches, detection techniques, and theoretical simulations for future studies of cytochrome P450 Compound I. This mini-review is dedicated to Klaus Ruckpaul on the occasion of his 80th birthday.},

  abstract={Exact decoupling of positive- and negative-energy states in relativistic quantum chemistry is discussed in the framework of unitary transformation techniques. The obscure situation that each scheme of decoupling transformations relies on different, but very special parametrizations of the employed unitary matrices is critically analyzed. By applying the most general power series ansatz for the parametrization of the unitary matrices it is shown that all transformation protocols for decoupling the Dirac Hamiltonian have necessarily to start with an initial free-particle {Foldy-Wouthuysen} step. The purely numerical iteration scheme applying X-operator techniques to the {Barysz-Sadlej-Snijders} {(BSS)} Hamiltonian is compared to the analytical schemes of the {Foldy-Wouthuysen} {(FW)} and {Douglas-Kroll-Hess} {(DKH)} approaches. Relying on an illegal 1/c expansion of the Dirac Hamiltonian around the nonrelativistic limit, any higher-order {FW} transformation is in principle ill defined and doomed to fail, irrespective of the specific features of the external potential. It is shown that the {DKH} method is the only valid analytic unitary transformation scheme for the Dirac Hamiltonian. Its exact infinite-order version can be realized purely numerically by the {BSS} scheme, which is only able to yield matrix representations of the decoupled Hamiltonian but no analytic expressions for this operator. It is explained why a straightforward numerical iterative extension of the {DKH} procedure to arbitrary order employing matrix representations is not feasible within standard one-component electronic structure programs. A more sophisticated ansatz based on a symbolical evaluation of the {DKH} operators via a suitable parser routine is needed instead and introduced in Part {II} of this work.},

  abstract={In order to achieve exact decoupling of the Dirac Hamiltonian within a unitary transformation scheme, we have discussed in part I of this series that either a purely numerical iterative technique (the {Barysz-Sadlej-Snijders} method) or a stepwise analytic approach (the {Douglas-Kroll-Hess} method) are possible. For the evaluation of {Douglas-Kroll-Hess} Hamiltonians up to a pre-defined order it was shown that a symbolic scheme has to be employed. In this work, an algorithm for this analytic derivation of {Douglas-Kroll-Hess} Hamiltonians up to any arbitrary order in the external potential is presented. We discuss how an estimate for the necessary order for exact decoupling (within machine precision) for a given system can be determined from the convergence behavior of the {Douglas-Kroll-Hess} expansion prior to a quantum chemical calculation. Once this maximum order has been accomplished, the spectrum of the positive-energy part of the decoupled Hamiltonian, e.g., for electronic bound states, cannot be distinguished from the corresponding part of the spectrum of the Dirac operator. An efficient scalar-relativistic implementation of the symbolic operations for the evaluation of the positive-energy part of the block-diagonal Hamiltonian is presented, and its accuracy is tested for ground-state energies of one-electron ions over the whole periodic table. Furthermore, the first many-electron calculations employing sixth up to fourteenth order {DKH} Hamiltonians are presented.},

  abstract={Recent advances in the theory of the infinite-order {Douglas-Kroll-Hess} {(DKH)} transformation of the Dirac Hamiltonian require a fresh and unified view on the calculation of atomic and molecular properties. It is carefully investigated how the four-component Dirac Hamiltonian in the presence of arbitrary electric and magnetic potentials is decoupled to two-component form. In order to cover the whole range of electromagnetic properties on the same footing, a consistent description within the {DKH} theory is presented. Subtle distinctions are needed between errors arising from any finite-order {DKH} scheme and effects due to oversimplified and thus approximate decoupling strategies for the Dirac operator, which will, though being numerically negligible in most cases, still be visible in the infinite-order limit of the two-component treatment. Special focus is given to the issue, whether the unitary {DKH} transformations to be applied to the Dirac Hamiltonian should depend on the property under investigation or not. It is explicitly shown that up to third order in the external potential the transformed property operator is independent of the chosen parametrization of the unitary transformations of the generalized {DKH} scheme. Since the standard {DKH} protocol covers the transformation of one-electron integrals only, the presentation is developed for one-electron properties for the sake of brevity. Nevertheless, all findings for the calculation of one-electron properties within a two-component framework presented here also hold for two-electron properties as well.},

  abstract={New basis sets of the atomic natural orbital {(ANO)} type have been developed for the first, second, and third row transition metal atoms. The {ANOs} have been obtained from the average density matrix of the ground and lowest excited states of the atom, the positive and negative ions, and the atom in an electric field. Scalar relativistic effects are included through the use of a {Douglas-Kroll-Hess} Hamiltonian. Multiconfigurational wave functions have been used with dynamic correlation included using second order perturbation theory {(CASSCF/CASPT2).} The basis sets are applied in calculations of ionization energies, electron affinities, and excitation energies for all atoms and polarizabilities for spherically symmetric atoms. These calculations include spin-orbit coupling using a variation-perturbation approach. Computed ionization energies have an accuracy better than 0.2 {eV} in most cases. The accuracy of computed electron affinities is the same except in cases where the experimental values are smaller than 0.5 {eV.} Accurate results are obtained for the polarizabilities of atoms with spherical symmetry. Multiplet levels are presented for some of the third row transition metals.},

  abstract={The n-electron valence state perturbation theory {(NEVPT)} is a form of multireference perturbation theory which is based on a zero order reference wavefunction of {CAS-CI} type (complete active space configuration interaction) and which is characterized by the utilization of correction functions (zero order wavefunctions external to the {CAS)} of multireference nature, obtained through the diagonalization of a suitable two-electron model Hamiltonian {(Dyall’s} Hamiltonian) in some well defined determinant spaces. A review of the {NEVPT} approach is presented, starting from the original second order state-specific formulation, going through the quasidegenerate multi-state extension and arriving at the recent implementations of the third order in the energy and of the internally contracted configuration interaction. The chief properties of {NEVPT—size} consistence and absence of intruder states—are analyzed. Finally, an application concerning the calculation of the vertical spectrum of the biologically important free base porphin molecule, is presented.},

The present implementation concerns the so-called strongly contracted variant of {NEVPT,} where only a subspace of the first-order interacting space is taken into account. The resulting strongly contracted {NEVPT3} approach is discussed in three test cases: (a) the energy difference between the {3B1} and {1A1} states of the methylene molecule, (b) the potential-energy curve of the N2 molecule ground state, and (c) the chromium dimer {(Cr2)} ground-state potential-energy profile. Particular attention is devoted to the last case where large basis sets comprising also h orbitals are adopted and where remarkable differences between the second- and third-order results show up.},
